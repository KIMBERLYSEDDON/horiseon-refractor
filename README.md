# horiseon-refractor
## Description
Refactoring an ad agency's website to better improve it's accessibility in order to be optimized by search engines. 

With more accessibility, more people can access the information on this application.

Code was also cleaned up in order to ease future edits.

A few bugs fixed as well.

I learned quite a bit about layout and consolidation of css during this process
